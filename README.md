# Multi Back
Example of a Backbone client app with NodeJS server

This was my first attempt at playing with Backbone, so take it with a grain of salt. It sort of simulates a chatroom.

To install, type 'npm update' to get the packages, then 'node app.js' to run the server, then point your browser to http://localhost:3000/

You can try it without the node backend, just by opening the file static/index.html in your browser. You will get console errors
when it tries to communicate with the server, but the client side will work.
